# ikouka

**ikouka** is a component library for prototyping React-apps without the hassle of recreating the same basic components all over again.

## Getting Started

First install the package:

```bash
npm install ikouka
```

Next, at the base of your app include the CSS:

```js
import 'ikouka/dist/tailwind.css'
```

Then import and use the components:

```js
import { Button } from 'ikouka'
```

Documentation is available [here](https://ikouka.vercel.app/). TS-Types are included in the package. 行こうか！
